=head1 NAME

Debuggit - A fairly simplistic debug statement handler

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Debuggit DEBUG => 1;

    # say you have a global hashref for your site configuration
    # (not to imply that global vars are good)
    our $Config = get_global_config();

    # now we can set some config things based on whether we're in debug mode or not
    $Config->{'DB'} = DEBUG ? 'dev' : 'prod';

    # maybe we need to pull our local Perl modules from our VC working copy
    push @INC, $Config->{'vcdir/lib'} if DEBUG;

    # basic debugging output
    debuggit("only print this if debugging is on");
    debuggit(3 => "only print this if debugging is level 3 or higher");

    # show off our formatting
    my $var1 = 6;
    my $var2;
    my $var3 = " leading and trailing spaces   ";
    # assuming debugging is enabled ...
    debuggit("var1 is", $var1);   # var1 is 6
    debuggit("var2 is", $var2);   # var2 is <<undef>>
    debuggit("var3 is", $var3);   # var3 is << leading and trailing spaces   >>
    # note that spaces between args, as well as final newlines, are provided automatically

    # use "functions" in the debugging args list
    my $var4 = { complex => 'hash', with => 'lots', of => 'stuff' };
    # this will call Data::Dumper::Dumper() for you
    # (even if you've never loaded Data::Dumper)
    debuggit("var4 is", DUMP => $var4);

    # make your own function
    Debuggit::add_func(CONFIG => 1,
            sub { my ($self, $var) = $_; return (lc($self), 'var', $var, 'is', $Config->{$var}) });
    # and use it like so
    debuggit(CONFIG => 'DB');     # config var DB is dev


=head1 DESCRIPTION

You want debugging?  No, you want sophisticated, full-featured, on-demand debugging, and you don't
want to take it out when you release the code because you might need it again later, but you also
don't want it to take up any space or cause any slowdown of your production application.  Sound
impossible?  Nah.  Just use Debuggit.


=head2 Quick Start

To start:

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use Debuggit;


    my $var = 6;
    debuggit(2 => "var is", $var);      # this does not print
    debuggit(4 => "var is", $var);      # neither does this

Later ...

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use Debuggit DEBUG => 2;


    my $var = 6;
    debuggit(2 => "var is", $var);      # now this prints
    debuggit(4 => "var is", $var);      # but this still doesn't

That's it.  Really.  Everything else is just gravy.

=head1 EXPORTS

=head2 DEBUG

DEBUG is a constant integer set to whatever value you choose:

    use Debuggit DEBUG => 2;

or to 0 if you don't choose:

    use Debuggit;

Actually, failure to specify a value only defaults to 0 the first time in a program this is seen.
Subsequent times (e.g. in modules included by the main script), DEBUG will be set to the first value
passed in.  In this way, you can set DEBUG in the main script and have it "fall through" to all
included modules.  See L<Debuggit::Manual/"The DEBUG Constant"> for full details.

=head2 Functions exported

Only L</debuggit> is exported.

=head2 debuggit

Use this function to conditionally print debugging output.  If the first argument is a positive
integer, the output is printed only if DEBUG is set to that number or higher.  The remaining
arguments are concatenated with spaces, a newline is appended, and the results are printed to
STDERR.  Some minor formatting is done to help distinguish C<undef> values and values with leading
or trailing spaces.  To get further details, or to learn how to override any of those things, see
L<Debuggit::Manual/"The debuggit function">.

=head2 default_formatter

This is what C<debuggit> is set to initially.  You can call it directly if you want to "wrap"
C<debuggit>.  For examples of this, see L<Debuggit::Cookbook/"Wrapping the debugging output">.

BEGIN
{
    # This is an anonymous closure.  It has to be both of those things.
    #   *   It has to be anonymous because it may be put into different packages depending on the
    #       circumstances.  See the comments in _setup_funcs() for further details on that.
    #   *   It has to be a closure because we want the debug value (against which we have to check
    #       the first arg, if it's a positive integer), to be stored with the sub.  We in turn want
    #       this for several reasons:
    #       -   We have to reference the DEBUG value in the calling package.
    #       -   If we determine that via reference, that works for most cases.  But in the case of
    #           Moose classes, most of which are autocleaned, the DEBUG constant, which is just a
    #           function, may well be gone by the time debuggit() runs.  If we were calling it
    #           directly, autocleaning wouldn't keep that from working.  But calling by reference is
    #           a whole different story.
    #       -   So our best bet is to use a closure.  The $debug_value referred to below must exist
    #           in the scope in which this is eval'ed.  Then that value gets wrapped in the closure
    #           and it doesn't matter a whit if the function is autocleaned.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item * Cannot redefine DEBUG; original value of %s is used

It means you did something like this:

    use Debuggit DEBUG => 2;
    use Debuggit DEBUG => 3;

only probably not nearly so obvious.  Debuggit tries to be very tolerant of multiple imports into
the same package, but the C<DEBUG> symbol is a constant function and can't be redefined without
engendering severe wonkiness, so Debuggit won't do it.  As long as you pass the same value for
C<DEBUG>, that's okay.  But if the second (or more) value is different from the first, then you will
get the original value regardless.  At least this way you'll be forewarned.

=back



=head1 PERFORMANCE

Debuggit is designed to be left in your code, even when running in production environments.
Because of this, it needs to disappear entirely when debugging is turned off.  It can achieve this
unlikely goal via the use of a compile-time constant.  Please see
L<Debuggit::Manual/"Performance Considerations"> for full details.



=head1 BUGS and CAVEATS

=over

=item *

Once you set C<DEBUG>, you can't change it.  Even if you try, you get the original value.  See
L</DIAGNOSTICS>.

=item *

Doing:

    debuggit(0 => "in production mode");

never prints anything, even when C<DEBUG> is 0.  That's because C<debuggit> is guaranteed to be an
empty function when debugging is turned off.

=item *

Doing:

    debuggit($var, "is the value");

is inherently dangerous.  If C<$var> is a positive integer, C<debuggit> would interpret it as a
debug level, and not print it.  So, either do this:

    debuggit(1 => $var, "is the value");

or this:

    debuggit("the value is", $var);

Or, to look at it another way, you can pass a value as the first arg to print, or you can leave off
a debugging level altogether, but don't try to do both at once.

=item *

Doing:

    my $var1 = "DUMP";
    my $var2 = "stuff";
    debuggit(1 => "vars are", $var1, $var2);

is equivalent to:

    debuggit(1 => "vars are", DUMP => $var2);

which is probably not going to do what you want, assuming the default functions are still in place.
See L<Debuggit::Manual/"IMPORTANT CAVEAT!"> for full details.

=item *

Doing:

    debuggit(2 => "first thousand elements:", @array[0..999]);

is likely going to have a performance impact even when debugging is off.  Instead, do:

    debuggit("first thousand elements:", @array[0..999]) if DEBUG >= 2;

See L<Debuggit::Manual/"Style Considerations"> for another example and details on the problem.

=back

That's all I know of.  However, lacking omniscience, I welcome bug reports.



=head1 SUPPORT

Debuggit is on GitHub at barefootcoder/debuggit.  Feel free to fork and submit patches.  Please note
that I develop via TDD (Test-Driven Development), so a patch that includes a failing test is much
more likely to get accepted (or least likely to get accepted more quickly).

If you just want to report a problem or suggest a feature, that's okay too.  You can create an issue
on GitHub, or a bug in CPAN's RT (at http://rt.cpan.org).  Or just send an email to
bug-Debuggit@rt.cpan.org.
