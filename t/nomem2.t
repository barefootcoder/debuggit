# 2 - virtual memory size
# 3 - resident set size
# 4 - shared memory size
# 5 - text (aka code or exe) size
# 6 - data and stack size

# The one we care about is virtsz.  Generally speaking, RSS and shared size seem to fluctuate based
# on nothing that I can determine (possibly OS, whatever other processes are running, sunspots,
# etc).  The virtsz seems to be text + data, which makes sense.  Thus, virtsz is the only one we
# really need to look at.  Note that all sizes are in kilobytes.


# For some reason I am utterly unable to fathom, Test::More interacts with Memory::Usage in an
# unfavorable way.  If I run this code directly in the test script, it always reports an increase.
# So, to get around that, we'll just run the code in its own perl instance.
